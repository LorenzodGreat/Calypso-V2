When your package shows “delivered” from your retailer, please allow up to 48-72 business hours for Calypso Shipping to post it to your account. We process packages in the order that they are received and because we receive hundreds of packages per day, we aren’t always able to post all packages to their respective accounts on the same day. However, if you have the tracking # for your package we can certainly confirm where it is in the system at the moment. Once updated to your account you will receive an email verification. In the meantime, please feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding the status of your package(s).</dd>

Customers have 30 days after being alerted that the package is ready for pickup to claim their package, after the first 30 days a storage fee of $2.00 USD will be applied for each day leading up to the 30 days maximum limit before the package becomes owned by Calypso Shipping.</dd>

                                    <dd class="mt-3 text-sm text-red-400">A.	Freight companies like us as well as a multitude of other companies rely heavily on the airlines for access to their limited space. Although we require a consistent, predictable service, there are times when the airlines reschedule our shipments in favor of perishable-item shipments and resume our service afterwards. The combination of fewer flights and increased shipping demand results in delays that we cannot control. Flight delays are an inescapable occurrence. The only precaution to minimize the inconvenience is to shop early wherever possible.</dd>
